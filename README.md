# Year Bingo 2026

A customizable, editable bingo board for setting and tracking personal goals for the year 2026.  
Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Works fully in the browser — no backend required.


## Why a Bingo Card?

A traditional New Year’s resolution list often falls flat — you get busy, forget, or lose motivation.  

A **bingo card** turns your goals into a **fun, visual game**:  

-  You get motivated to complete the bingo.  
-  Mix **easy goals** with the ones you really want to achieve.  
-  Seeing your progress encourages consistent effort.  

By turning your goals into a board, you’re more likely to **stay engaged and complete them** throughout the year.
